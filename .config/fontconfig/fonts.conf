    Redefine system Serif, Sans, and Monospace fonts.
    Debian's default aliases use the DejaVu family.
    Although DejaVu is a solid family, the super-wide
    glyphs are quite the annoyance!  Nimbus, on the
    other hand, looks a lot like Helvetica and is
    really beautiful.

    As of Jul 28 2016 this has a major flaw: Chrome
    silently renders nothing where the Nimbus fonts
    are called for.  In fact, the font options glitch
    t.f. out when I try to select fonts in the Nimbus
    family.  Is Chrome unable to render Type1 fonts?

    The temporary solution is to select the Liberation
    series for now. They look almost as good as Nimbus.
